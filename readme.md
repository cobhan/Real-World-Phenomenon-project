<h3>Programming for Data Analysis Module</h3>
<p>In this repository you will find my project for the Programming for Data Analysis module. The project instructions are:</p> 
<ul><li>Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.</li>
<li>Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.</li>
<li>Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.</li>
<li>Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.</li></ul>
